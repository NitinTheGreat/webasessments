    <p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the past year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>

    <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

    <h2>Product categories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Props</a></li>

        <li><a href="#">Special Effects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Masks</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My guarantee</h2>
    <p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <b>No questions asked!</b></p>
